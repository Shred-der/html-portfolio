<h1>The best movies according to Mighty</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Favourite Anime, carries all sorts of individual life experiences; pain, sorrow, joy, defeat, victory... basically life in general</p>
<h3>The Man from Earth</h3>
<p>This movie will make you question things and mess with your mind in a real way... That's actually a warning, I'm serious, don't watch it!</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>This might be the best literature piece ever made, I'd bet a million dollars that you will not be able to predict it</p>
