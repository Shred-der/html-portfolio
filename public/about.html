<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a deeply observant individual with a strong bias toward mastery, discipline, and long-term thinking. I am drawn to complex systems whether technical, human, or conceptual and I spend much of my time understanding how things actually work beneath the surface.
  I value depth over noise, precision over speed, and substance over visibility. While I tend to keep a low profile, I hold myself to exceptionally high standards in anything I commit to. I believe excellence is not accidental; it is the result of patience, deliberate practice, and an uncompromising relationship with truth.
  My interests sit at the intersection of technology, human behavior, and creative problem-solving. I am motivated by building things that scale, endure, and matter, work that has measurable impact beyond short-term trends.
  I am not interested in appearing capable.
  I am interested in becoming undeniable
